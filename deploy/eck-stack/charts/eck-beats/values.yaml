# Default values for eck-beats.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.

# Overridable names of the Beats resource.
# By default, this is the Release name set for the chart,
# followed by 'eck-beats'.
#
# nameOverride will override the name of the Chart with the name set here,
# so nameOverride: quickstart, would convert to '{{ Release.name }}-quickstart'
#
# nameOverride: "quickstart"
#
# fullnameOverride will override both the release name, and the chart name,
# and will name the Beats resource exactly as specified.
